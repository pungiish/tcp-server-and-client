# tcp-server-and-client
I've created my own chat app with a server and a client wpf app.
1. start the server, 
2. in the solution explorer right click Client -> debug -> start new instance. You can open multiple clients,
3. connect to localhost 127.0.0.1 and port 1234,
4. chat,
5. start the game with #GAMESTART. The app will call oxford dictionary API with a query and return programming related words,
6. play the game, when you guess the word you get a point,
7. stop the game with #GAMESTOP.

TODO: Add the functionality to send/receive files.
